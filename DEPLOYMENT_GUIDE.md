# üöÄ Enhanced SOL AI Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Hardhat setup
- Somnia testnet access
- Private key with testnet funds

## Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

## Step 2: Compile Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## Step 3: Deploy Enhanced Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat run deploy.js --network somnia
```

## Step 4: Update Environment Variables

After deployment, update the following files with the new contract addresses:

### contracts/.env
```env
SOCIAL_POSTS_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
MODERATOR_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
REPUTATION_SYSTEM_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
REPUTATION_SBT_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
SOL_TOKEN_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
INCENTIVE_SYSTEM_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
GOVERNANCE_SYSTEM_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
```

### agent/.env
```env
REPUTATION_SYSTEM_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
REPUTATION_SBT_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
SOL_TOKEN_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
INCENTIVE_SYSTEM_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
GOVERNANCE_SYSTEM_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
```

### app/.env.local
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_REPUTATION_SYSTEM_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_REPUTATION_SBT_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOL_TOKEN_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_INCENTIVE_SYSTEM_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOVERNANCE_SYSTEM_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
```

## Step 5: Generate ABIs
After deployment, copy the ABI files:
```bash
# Copy ABIs to frontend
cp artifacts/contracts/ReputationSystem.sol/ReputationSystem.json app/contracts/abis/
cp artifacts/contracts/ReputationSBT.sol/ReputationSBT.json app/contracts/abis/
cp artifacts/contracts/IncentiveSystem.sol/SOLToken.json app/contracts/abis/
cp artifacts/contracts/IncentiveSystem.sol/IncentiveSystem.json app/contracts/abis/
cp artifacts/contracts/GovernanceSystem.sol/GovernanceSystem.json app/contracts/abis/
```

## Step 6: Restart Services
```bash
# Restart agent
cd agent
python app.py

# Restart frontend
cd app
npm run dev
```
