## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "abi.map is not a function"
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
**Solution**: ABI extraction logic added to handle artifact format

### Issue: Animations feel slow
**Solution**: Adjust duration in component files
```tsx
transition={{ duration: 0.2 }} // Make faster
```

### Issue: Toast notifications don't appear
**Check**:
1. ToastProvider is in page.tsx
2. Import toast from 'react-hot-toast'
3. No console errors

### Issue: Skeletons don't match theme
**Solution**: Update baseColor and highlightColor in LoadingSkeleton.tsx

### Issue: Counters jump instead of animate
**Check**:
1. framer-motion installed
2. useSpring hook working
3. Value prop is a number

## üìä Performance Checks

### Expected Metrics:
- **Initial Load**: < 3 seconds
- **Animation Duration**: 0.2-0.5 seconds
- **Toast Display**: 3-5 seconds
- **Skeleton Duration**: Until data loads
- **Counter Animation**: ~0.5 seconds

### Performance Tips:
1. Use `AnimatePresence` mode="popLayout" for lists
2. Limit simultaneous animations
3. Use `will-change` CSS sparingly
4. Optimize images and assets

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The enhancement is successful if:
1. ‚úÖ All existing features work
2. ‚úÖ No console errors
3. ‚úÖ Animations feel smooth (60fps)
4. ‚úÖ Loading states are clear
5. ‚úÖ Notifications are helpful
6. ‚úÖ UI feels more professional
7. ‚úÖ Blockchain integration intact
8. ‚úÖ Mobile experience is good

## üéØ Demo Script for Hackathon

### 1. Opening (30 seconds)
"SOL AI is a decentralized social media platform with AI-powered content moderation. Notice the smooth animations as posts load..."

### 2. Create Post (45 seconds)
"Let me create a post. Watch the loading toast as it submits to the blockchain... and there's the success notification! The new post animates in smoothly."

### 3. AI Moderation (60 seconds)
"Now let me post something toxic to demonstrate our AI moderation. Watch the counter update... and there's the flagging notification! The post is automatically flagged within seconds."

### 4. User Experience (30 seconds)
"Notice the hover effects, the animated counters, and the professional loading states. Every interaction has been carefully crafted for a delightful user experience."

### 5. Closing (15 seconds)
"All of this runs on the Somnia blockchain with transparent, on-chain moderation. Thank you!"

## üîç Debug Commands

### Check if animations are working:
```javascript
// In browser console
document.querySelectorAll('[style*="transform"]').length // Should be > 0
```

### Check toast system:
```javascript
// In browser console
import('react-hot-toast').then(m => m.default.success('Test!'))
```

### Check framer-motion:
```javascript
// In browser console
window.FramerMotion // Should be defined
```
